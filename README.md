## üë®‚Äçüíª Professional Background

With over four years of comprehensive end-to-end SDLC experience, I've led the development of high-impact projects, including the PESTOS loan origination system at Maybank, Bangalore, India. My expertise spans across programming languages like Python, Java, SQL, PL/SQL, and JavaScript, with a solid foundation in technologies such as Spring, Spring Batch, Hibernate, React, and AWS. My role as a Senior Software Engineer allowed me to implement dynamic credit risk tools, enhance system scalability, and lead development teams to success, earning me the title of the youngest employee to spearhead a team.

## üìò Education & Learning Journey

Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics, I am diving deep into Advanced Machine Learning, Unstructured Data Analytics, Optimization, and several other courses that are sharpening my data intuition and analytical prowess. My coursework is not just theoretical; I've applied these concepts in projects like the Neural Network-Based Image Classifier and a Crowdsourced Recommender System, pushing the envelope in practical, real-world applications of ML.

## üöÄ Projects Highlight

- **Neural Network-Based Image Classifier**: Developed and trained CNN and transformer neural networks, achieving over 99% accuracy on MNIST. Built an interactive classification web application hosted on AWS.
- **Crowdsourced Recommender System**: Leveraged NLP, cosine similarity, VADER sentiment analysis, and word vectors to create a system that crafts beer recommendations based on user preferences.

## üí° Skills & Expertise

- **Languages & Technologies**: Proficient in Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, R, PL/SQL, HTML, CSS; well-versed in Spring, Spring Batch, Hibernate, React, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Pandas, Scikit-learn, REST APIs, AWS, Snowflake, Neo4j and Oracle.
- **Analytical Skills**: Advanced data management and analytics, with a strong grip on machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and model optimization.
- **Professional Skills**: Agile project management, quick learning, requirement gathering, and a keen data intuition developed through hands-on experience in software development and analytics.

## üèÜ Achievements

- Youngest employee to lead a development team.
- Star of the Release award for best consistent performance over 6 months.
- Awarded Best Individual Performer of the Sprint three times.

## üìö Continuous Learning

I am committed to continuous learning and improvement, currently enhancing my AI/ML skills through rigorous academic and project work. My goal is to synthesize my software engineering background with advanced analytics to drive innovation and solve complex problems in data science and software development space with a focus on areas that intersect both.
